# 
# range(Y) generates a sequence of all non-negative integers less than Y.
# Ex: range(3) creates the sequence 0, 1, 2.
# range(X, Y) generates a sequence of all integers >= X and < Y.
# Ex: range(-7, -3) creates the sequence -7, -6, -5, -4.
# range(X, Y, Z), where Z is positive, generates a sequence of all integers >= X and < Y, incrementing by Z.
# Ex: range(0, 50, 10) creates the sequence 0, 10, 20, 30, 40.
# range(X, Y, Z), where Z is negative, generates a sequence of all integers <= X and > Y, incrementing by Z.
# Ex: range(3, -1, -1) creates the sequence 3, 2, 1, 0.

#  As a general rule:
# 
# Use a for loop when the number of iterations is computable before entering the loop, as when counting down from X to 0, printing a string N times, etc.
# Use a for loop when accessing the elements of a container, as when adding 1 to every element in a list, or printing the key of every entry in a dict, etc.
# Use a while loop when the number of iterations is not computable before entering the loop, as when iterating until a user enters a particular character.
