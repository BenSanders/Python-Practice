# Arithmetic expressions
## Basics
* Expression is a combination of items, like variables, literals, operators, and parentheses, that evaluates to a value, like 2*(x+1).

* '+' is the addition operator, as in x + y
* '-' is the subtraction operator, as in x - y. Also, the - operator is for negation, as in -x + y or x + -y
* '*' is the multiplication operator, as in x * y
* '/' is the division operator, as in x / y
* '**' is the exponent operator, as in x `**` y (x to the power of y)

# Evaluation of expressions
Expression evaluates to a value, which replaces the expression

Example:
	If x is 5, then x + 1 evaluates to 6, and y = x + 1 assigns y with 6.
