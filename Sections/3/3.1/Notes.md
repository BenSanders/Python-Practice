Variable - named item, such aas x or num_people, used to hold a value
Assignment statement - assigns with a value, such as x = 5.



1. In programming, a variable is a place to hold a value. Here, variables x, y, and z are depicted graphically as boxes.
2. An assignment statement assigns the left-side variable with the right-side expression's value. x = 5 assigns x with 5.
3. y = x assigns y with x's value, which presently is 5. z = x + 2 assigns z with x's present value plus 2, so 5 + 2 or 7.
4. A subsequent x = 3 statement assigns x with 3. x's former value of 5 is overwritten and thus lost. Note that the values held in y and z are unaffected, remaining as 5 and 7.
5. In algebra, an equation means "the item on the left always equals the item on the right." So for x + y = 5 and x * y = 6, one can determine x = 2 and y = 3.
6. Assignment statements look similar but have VERY different meaning. The left side MUST be one variable.
7. The = isn't "equals," but is an action that PUTS a value into the variable. Assignment statements only make sense when executed in sequence.


# = is not equals

In programming, = is an assignment of a left-side variable with a right-side value. = is NOT equality as in mathematics. Thus, x = 5 is read as "x is assigned with 5," and not as "x equals 5." When one sees x = 5, one might think of a value being put into a box.
