# Instructions
# Finish the program to compute how many gallons of paint are needed to cover the given square feet of walls. Assume 1 gallon can cover 350.0 square feet. So gallons = the square feet divided by 350.0. If the input is 250.0, the output should be:
# 
# 0.714285714286
# 
# Note: Do not format the output. 

wall_area = float(input())

# Assign gallons_paint below

# ''' Your solution goes here '''
gallons_paint = wall_area/350.0

print(gallons_paint)
