# Properties of objects

Each Python object has three defining properties: value, type, and identity.

	Value: A value such as "20", "abcdef", or 55.
	Type: The type of the object, such as integer or string.
	Identity: A unique identifier that describes the object

The built-in function `type()` returns the type of an object.

The id() built-in function yields the object's unique identity, which is typically the location in memory where the object is stored.
