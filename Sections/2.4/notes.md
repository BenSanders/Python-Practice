# Programming is all about precision

Programming is all about precision. Programs must be created precisely to run correctly. Ex:

* = and == have different meanings.
* Using i where j was meant can yield a hard-to-find bug.
* Not considering that n could be 0 in sum/n can cause a program to fail entirely in rare but not insignificant cases.
* Counting from i being 0 to i < 10 vs. i <= 10 can mean the difference between correct output and a program outputting garbage.

This actually threw me for a loop gonna put it in my notes for posterity

```
If I and E are adjacent, I should come before E, except after C (where E should come before I). How many violations are in the following?
